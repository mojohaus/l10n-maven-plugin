Localization Tools Maven Plugin

 The Localization Tools Maven Plugin helps with internationalization and
 localization of your projects.

* Generate the Report

  To generate the localization report, just add the following in your project's
  <<<pom.xml>>>:

-------------------
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>l10n-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <locales>
            <locale>de</locale>
            <locale>es</locale>
            <locale>fr</locale>
            ...
          </locales>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
-------------------

  Add a <<<\<locale\>>>> element for every localization you have.

  The report will be generated when you execute the Maven site plugin, like this:

-------------------
mvn site
-------------------

  You can refer to the {{{./report-mojo.html}generated documentation}} to discover
  the different configuration options for the report mojo.
